# otree-3d-dice-roller
A 3d-dice-roller game for behavioral experiment using [o-Tree](http://www.otree.org/).

## Introduction

This app is a 3d dice roller, and the dice outcome is generated as variable "dice_number" inside Python. 

## Pages
1. Before instruction page, the dice outcome is determined as "dice_number";
2. At roll_dice page, the 3d dice simulation would ensure the outcome is "dice_number";
3. Finally, the Results page would present the "dice_number". 

## Customization

The dice roller simulation is based on [dice-box-threejs](https://github.com/3d-dice/dice-box-threejs) and you can add more features according to the package. Now the dice roller would only produce one outcome of a six-sided dice. 

And about the button at dice_roller page, the button is set to show up after 50ms for preparation of js web packages, and the button can only be clicked once.
